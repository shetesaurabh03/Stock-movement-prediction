Stock movement prediction
This project aims to predict stock price movements using SEC Form 8-K filings data. Form 8-K is a mandatory filing that companies must submit to report major events that shareholders should know about. Our objective is to analyze whether these regulatory filings can provide predictive signals for stock price movements in the following trading day.
In this project following things are achieved.

•	Developed LSTM Models for Stock Prediction: Built and optimized LSTM models in H2O for stock price forecasting, utilizing technical indicators like RSI, moving averages, and volume trends.

•	Used H2O for Financial Market Analytics: Applied H2O modelling for predictive analysis, enhancing model performance through feature scaling, cross-validation, and ensembling, improving stock prediction accuracy.
