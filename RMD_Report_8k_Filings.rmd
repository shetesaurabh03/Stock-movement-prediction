## Problem Description

This project aims to predict stock price movements using SEC Form 8-K filings data. Form 8-K is a mandatory filing that companies must submit to report major events that shareholders should know about. Our objective is to analyze whether these regulatory filings can provide predictive signals for stock price movements in the following trading day.

### Filing Distribution Analysis for top 10 companies

The chart highlights the top 10 companies by the number of 8-K filings. Wells Fargo leads with the highest number of filings, followed by AbbVie Inc. and JPMorgan Chase. This distribution indicates that financial and pharmaceutical companies are more frequent in their filings, potentially due to regulatory requirements or significant corporate activities. These trends provide insights into sectors with high reporting frequencies, reflecting their operational complexity and regulatory scrutiny.

```{r filing_distribution}
# Get top 10 companies by number of filings
top_10_companies <- data %>%
  count(company.name) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

# Plot for top 10 companies
ggplot(data = top_10_companies,

### AI/ML Procedure Summary

Our machine learning approach consisted of the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Text Cleaning and Normalization**: We preprocessed the raw data by removing special characters, normalizing text formats, and standardizing text fields to ensure consistency. This step was crucial for eliminating noise and preparing the data for further analysis.
   - **Feature Engineering from Market Data**: We extracted meaningful features from the market data, such as financial metrics and indicators that could influence risk assessments. This included transformations, scaling, and encoding of variables to make them suitable for model input.
   - **Class Balancing Techniques**: To address any class imbalance in the dataset, we employed oversampling and undersampling techniques, ensuring a balanced representation of each class for better model training.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - We designed a **Deep Learning model using the H2O framework**, which is well-suited for handling large datasets and complex neural network architectures.
   - The model included **three hidden layers** with 200, 100, and 50 neurons, progressively reducing the dimensionality and enabling the model to learn intricate patterns.
   - **RectifierWithDropout activation** was used to introduce non-linearity while preventing overfitting through dropout regularization.
   - The model used an **adaptive learning rate** to dynamically adjust during training, improving convergence.
   - **Class balancing** was enabled within the model training process to ensure fair treatment of all classes during the learning phase.

3. **Training Configuration**:
   - The dataset was split into **train/validation/test** sets in a ratio of 70/15/15 to facilitate model evaluation and ensure generalization.
   - **Early stopping** was employed based on the logloss metric to halt training when the model's performance on the validation set stopped improving, thereby preventing overfitting.
   - We incorporated **L1/L2 regularization** with a coefficient of `1e-5` to add penalty terms for weights, further promoting generalization and reducing overfitting.


## Model Results and Discussion
### Performance Metrics

```{r model_results}
# Model performance metrics
metrics <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Overall Accuracy", "Mean Per-Class Error", "LogLoss", "RMSE"),
  Value = c("74.27%", "66.19%", "0.6619", "0.4585")
)
 
# Display the table with a caption
kable(metrics, caption = "Overall Model Performance Metrics", 
      format = "markdown", digits = 2, align = 'c')
```

The results from the model performance evaluation indicate the following:

1. **Overall Accuracy (74.27%)**: The model correctly predicted the outcomes for 74.27% of all observations. This suggests that it performed reasonably well in classifying the data correctly.

2. **Mean Per-Class Error (66.19%)**: This metric shows that, on average, there was a 66.19% chance of misclassifying an observation in any given class. A higher value here points to challenges in accurately classifying all classes equally.

3. **LogLoss (0.6619)**: LogLoss measures the uncertainty of the predictions. A lower value is better, with 0 indicating perfect predictions. The current value suggests that while the model is competent, there is room for improvement in terms of confidence in its predictions.

4. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (0.4585)**: This indicates the average magnitude of the errors in predictions. An RMSE value of 0.4585 suggests that the model's errors are relatively small, but still present, implying some degree of model inaccuracy.

Overall, the metrics highlight that while the model performs moderately well there is a scope for performance improvement.

```{r}
conf_matrix <- matrix(
  c(916, 1, 8,
    105, 0, 1,
    204, 0, 5),
  nrow = 3,
  byrow = TRUE,
  dimnames = list(
    Actual = c("Negative", "Small Positive", "Strong Positive"),
    Predicted = c("Negative", "Small Positive", "Strong Positive")
  )
)
kable(as.data.frame(conf_matrix), 
      caption = "Confusion Matrix")

company_metrics <- data.frame(
  Company = top_10_companies$company.name,
  Accuracy = round(runif(10, 70, 80), 2)  # Example metrics
)

```
The results from the model confusion indicate the following:

1. **Performance by Class**:
   - **Negative Movements**: The model correctly identified 916 out of 925 cases (99.0% accuracy)
   - **Small Positive Movements**: Failed to correctly identify any cases (0% accuracy)
   - **Strong Positive Movements**: Only identified 5 out of 209 cases (2.4% accuracy)
 
2. **Bias Analysis**:
   - Strong bias towards predicting negative movements
   - Most positive movements (both small and strong) were incorrectly classified as negative
   - Out of 315 positive movement cases (106 small + 209 strong), only 6 were correctly identified
 
3. **Model Limitations**:
   - While overall accuracy is 74.27%, this is mainly due to good performance on the majority class (negative)
   - Poor performance on positive movement predictions limits practical usefulness
   - Severe class imbalance affects model's ability to learn positive movement patterns


### Overall Performance Analysis
 
1. **Overall Performance**:
   - 74.27% accuracy achieved
   - High mean per-class error (66.19%)
   - LogLoss of 0.6619 indicates uncertainty in predictions

2. **Class-wise Performance**:
   - Strong performance on negative returns (99% accuracy)
   - Poor prediction of positive returns
   - Clear bias towards majority class
 
3. **Key Challenges**:
   - Severe class imbalance
   - Complex text-price relationship
   - Market noise and external factors
 
4. **Future Improvements**:
   - Enhanced text feature engineering
   - Advanced class balancing techniques
   - Ensemble modeling approaches
   - Integration of market sentiment data
